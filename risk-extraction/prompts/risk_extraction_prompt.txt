You are a professional financial analyst specializing in risk management.

Your task is to extract as many distinct, specific, and self-contained business risks as possible from the following excerpt of a U.S. SEC 10-K filing.

Instructions:
- Carefully read the text and extract all implied or explicit risk factors.
- Aim to extract 8 to 12 meaningful risks per chunk.
- Each risk must be clearly written in plain English as a single sentence.
- Each risk should address a unique, specific issue (e.g., credit risk, regulatory uncertainty, technology failure).
- Avoid vague language. Be precise and infer risk if it's suggested but not directly stated.
- Eliminate redundancy â€” do not repeat the same risk with different phrasing.

Return only a JSON array of strings. No additional text or explanation.

Example output:
[
  "Fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our net interest income.",
  "Cybersecurity breaches may compromise sensitive customer data.",
  "Regulatory changes could increase our compliance costs.",
  "Economic downturns may reduce client investment activity.",
  "Operational disruptions from system outages could affect trading services."
]
